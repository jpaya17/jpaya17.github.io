        I learned to <span className="yellow">code </span> by building online

        I built my first web project back in 2008. I had been working in FM
        radio stations as an engineer for a few years and I wanted to take
        advantage of streaming technology to build a truly international and
        multilingual radio station on the internet.{" "}
        <span className="yellow">Groovalizacion </span>
        radio was born in 2008 in the midst of my travels (I lived in 7
        countries in 10 years). I built the first version and I have helped
        design the following versions although I didn’t develop them myself.
        During those years I was also developing a career as a DJ and music
        producer. I always had in the back of my mind that studying computer
        science would be a fantastic tool to renew my approach to music making
        and to open myself to new intellectual horizons.

        The technologies I have used the most so far are
        <span className="yellow"> Javascript </span> and

      <p>
        I took the ‘CS50' course at
        <span className="yellow"> Harvard University </span> online in 2017 and
        it was a revelation. I felt confident to take on more ambitious
        projects. I rebuilt my artist site using my newly-learned skills in
        <span className="yellow"> Python </span>and
        <span className="yellow"> Javascript </span>. I connected with more
        experienced developers as mentors and got involved in a few more
        projects in the following years. I did a{" "}
        <span className="yellow"> React </span>
        project last year for an internet radio that involved interactions with
        a map. I also built an architect portfolio using
        <span className="yellow"> jQuery </span> and Vapid. During the summer
        2019 I helped the Reveel team build their music metadata app on{" "}
        <span className="yellow"> React Native</span>.

        Currently I am developing a music creativity enhancing app with my
        brother using Firebase and Flutter.
