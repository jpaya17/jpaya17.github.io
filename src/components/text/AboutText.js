        A passionate <span className="yellow">Mobile Developer</span> specialised on Android applications.
      </h1>
      <p>
        I started working as an Android Developer in 2013.
        From that moment until now I have been learning the most used technologies related to Mobile and Web development.
        <br></br>As it is an industry in constant evolution I like to spend my free time working on personal projects to update
        my knowledge.
      </p>
      <h1 className="about-title">
        The technologies I have used the most so far are
        <span className="yellow"> Android SDK </span> and
        <span className="yellow"> Django. </span>
      </h1>
      <p>
        I took the â€˜Android Development Online Course For Professionals' course at <span className="yellow"> MindOrks </span> in 2019 and it was a revelation.
        It completely changed my approach on Software Development and I felt confident to take on more ambitious
        projects using the most trending tools like MVVM, Dagger and RxJava.
        I built an Instagram clone using all these mentioned technologies while I connected with some amazing Indian developers as mentors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I am working at ENGISOFT developing applications for hospitality industry.
        <br></br>
        Also working on my free time on an English-language-learning Android application and collaborating on the UrbanNoise open-source project.
